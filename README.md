# Covid19-Map
This web-app displays a map of the world with the number of cases it was made by an API from the UN website, HTML and javascript 
Here is a link to the website if you would like to take a look for yourself  https://covid19-map-ro.herokuapp.com/ .     PS:unfortunately the API I used to fetch the Covid-19 cases has been deprecated
